## Summary of Data Flow
1. User signs in (Google OAuth or email).
2. Employees and timeline data are fetched from Supabase using hooks (`useQueue`, `useTimeline`).
3. Volunteering actions are sent to `/api/employee/route.ts`, which uses `lib/dbHelpers.ts` to update the database (including timeline and total hours).
4. UI components (`employeeStack`, `employeeTimeline`) display live data, subscribing to changes via Supabase Realtime.
5. Theming and layout are managed globally in `app/layout.tsx` and `ThemeProvider`.

## Suggestions & To-Dos for Cleanup and Structure

- **Consolidate Utility Functions:**
  - Move all utility functions (e.g., initials, date formatting) to a single `lib/utils.ts` for reusability.
- **Consistent Naming:**
  - Standardize file and variable naming (e.g., `googleSignInButton.tsx.tsx` â†’ `GoogleSignInButton.tsx`).
- **Type Safety:**
  - Ensure all hooks and helpers use TypeScript types from `types/employee.ts` and `types/supabase.ts`.
- **API Structure:**
  - Consider splitting API endpoints by resource (e.g., `/api/employees`, `/api/timeline`) for clarity.
- **Component Organization:**
  - Group related components (e.g., stack, timeline, UI) into feature folders.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Add user-friendly error messages and loading states throughout the UI.
- **Testing:**
  - Add unit and integration tests for hooks, helpers, and API routes.
- **Documentation:**
  - Expand this doc with setup instructions, environment variables, and deployment notes.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Review UI for accessibility (color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize data fetching and consider pagination or virtualization for large lists.
- **Security:**
  - Review Supabase RLS policies and API endpoint protections.
